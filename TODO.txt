Greek Conjugator App - TODO
==========================

Current State:
--------------
- User authentication (register/login/logout) is working
- Smart practice for verbs is functional (session auto-starts, question selection is stable)
- Session ends after 5 questions or when no more verbs with conjugations are available
- Progress dashboard and stats are displayed
- Greek text normalization and answer validation are implemented
- Only a few verbs have full conjugation data in the database

Known Issues / Limitations:
--------------------------
- Smart practice session length is limited by number of verbs with conjugations
- Some verbs in the database have no conjugations (need to expand seed data)
- No audio or pronunciation support
- No advanced grammar explanations or hints
- No mobile/responsive optimizations
- No user settings or customization
- No admin interface for adding/editing verbs/conjugations

Next Steps / Improvements:
--------------------------
1. **Expand Verb Data:**
   - Add more verbs and full conjugation tables to backend/seed_db.py
   - Consider importing from open-source Greek verb datasets
2. **Improve Smart Practice:**
   - Make session length dynamic based on available data
   - Add spaced repetition review sessions (due cards)
   - Personalize verb selection based on user progress
3. **Add Audio Support:**
   - Integrate audio for verb pronunciation
   - Add audio playback buttons in practice sessions
4. **Enhance Grammar Coverage:**
   - Add smart/traditional practice for nouns, adjectives, articles
   - Add grammar explanations and hints
5. **UI/UX Improvements:**
   - Improve mobile responsiveness and accessibility
   - Add dark mode and user settings
6. **Admin Tools:**
   - Build admin interface for managing verbs/conjugations
   - Allow bulk import/export of data
7. **Testing & QA:**
   - Add unit and integration tests for backend and frontend
   - Improve error handling and user feedback
8. **Deployment:**
   - Prepare for production deployment (Docker, HTTPS, etc.)
   - Add documentation for deployment and scaling
