- **FIXED**: Updated backend to use difficulty level 3 by default and removed all subscription tier restrictions
- **FIXED**: Updated frontend to use difficulty level 3 by default
- All users now have access to all 1,100+ verbs with conjugations

**Issue 2: Navigation Loop in Practice**
- After practice session ends, both "Flashcards" and "Smart Practice" buttons lead back to smart practice
- No way to return to home screen after entering smart practice
- Need to fix navigation flow and add proper home screen return option

**Issue 3: Missing Home Screen Navigation**
- No clear way to return to main dashboard/home screen from practice mode
- Users get stuck in practice loop with no escape route
- Need to add home/back navigation buttons

**Issue 4: Subscription Tier Restrictions Removed** ✅ **FIXED**

- All features available to all users

Known Issues / Limitations:
--------------------------
- Smart practice session length is limited by number of verbs with conjugations (98 verbs)
- 514 verbs still have no conjugations (these are likely rare or specialized verbs)
- No audio or pronunciation support
- No advanced grammar explanations or hints
- No mobile/responsive optimizations
- No user settings or customization
- No admin interface for adding/editing verbs/conjugations
