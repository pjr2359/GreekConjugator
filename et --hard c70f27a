[33m04046ea[m Fix smart practice session logic, stabilize question selection, and improve session completion.\n\n- Fixed frontend so smart practice session starts automatically.\n- Fixed bug where question changed on every keystroke by storing selected conjugation in state.\n- Improved session completion logic: session now ends after 5 questions or when no more verbs with conjugations are available.\n- Added instructions for adding more conjugations to seed data.\n- General code cleanup and improved user experience for smart practice.\n\nKnown limitation: session length is limited by number of verbs with conjugations in the database. To increase session length, add more conjugations to backend/seed_db.py.\n\nSee context.txt and TODO.txt for more details on app purpose and next steps.
